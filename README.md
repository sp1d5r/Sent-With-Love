## History 
This program was designed to send loving emails, at random intervals throughout the year to family/significant people in my life. I want to build this because I think a random email from someone you care about reminding you how much they care about you can have a positive impact on the rest of your day. As a computer scientist this is a piece of software i can develop (with hopefully not too much difficulty) and make my circle a tiny bit more positive.

## Breaking the Problem Down
Breaking down the problem we can see there are a few sub-problems which should each be solved before trying to create a final solution. Hopefully my solution can solve the following sub problems:
* [Sending an Email using Python](*sending-an-email-using-python)
* [Getting the Messages to Send](*getting-the-messages-to-send)
* [Getting the Replies](*getting-the-replies)
